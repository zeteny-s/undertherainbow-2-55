  # Fix RLS policies for invoices table

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing overly permissive policy
    - Create specific policies for different operations
    - Allow public access for invoice uploads (anon users)
    - Allow authenticated users to manage their data

  2. Policy Details
    - INSERT: Allow anon and authenticated users to insert invoices
    - SELECT: Allow anon and authenticated users to read invoices
    - UPDATE: Allow anon and authenticated users to update invoices
    - DELETE: Allow anon and authenticated users to delete invoices

  Note: This maintains the current functionality while fixing RLS violations
